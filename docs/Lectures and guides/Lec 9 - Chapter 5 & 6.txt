CHAPTER 5: SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION AND TESTING [normal web/mobile apps, IoT Projects, ML]

5.1 Introduction 
- Describe and state the sections covered in the chapter

5.2 Description of the Implementation Environment

(Hardware)
5.2.1 Hardware Specifications
- Specs used in various Hardware [computers and servers]---> always discuss
	- Mobile phone, tell us the specs of the phone 
- Describe and discuss each and every sensor used, boards used and their functionalities [include if you're using IoT]
	- Like, Humidity, Oxygen, BME280 sensor [5.2.1.1-->]
	- You can provide images here as well, just one image

5.2.2 Software Specifications
- Define and describe the software required to run your project e.g Android 7+, or Windows server 2020, Windows OS, Linux Box
- In Case of additional software, you may include it here [IoT]
	- Applications used in running the projects [sms server, email server, firebase]
(ML)
5.3 Description of the Dataset
- Discuss the dataset, how it was retrieved, analysis of the data in it. 
- Discuss, Training data, testing data and Validation data--> Give more information about this data
- Discuss the features and labels as extracted and used. 
	- Discuss how the features were retrieved, one hot encoding. 

5.4 Description of Testing
- Discuss how testing was done.

5.4.1 [ML]
- Discuss how training was done, mention how you prepared your data and files imported
	- you may support this with some screenshots of the code and some of the graphs
- Discuss how models were analysed and saved [how it was prepared] and graphs analysed 
- Did you use 10 fold testing??

5.4.1 [IoT]
- How the setup was done
- How testing was done to confirm the full functionality of the circuits
- Any other modules [WiFi, Sms and etc]
	- You can add some of the screenshots here - IDE, etc

5.4.2 Testing Paradigm
- Discuss the testing paradigm used in details [provide a diagram if possible]
	- White box testing
	- Black box testing
	- Unit Testing
		- You can support this with a screenshot of the unit test done
	- A combination of any two?
- You need to modify this section based on your project [ML, IoT]

5.5 Testing Results
- Draw a table of modules done and their testing results
	- Test Case
	- Description 
	- Test Data [what data was used in the testing]
	- Experimental Outcome
		- Result
		- Test Verdict [pass:fail?]


CHAPTER 6: CONCLUSIONS, RECOMMENTATIONS AND FUTURE WORKS [1 Page MAX]

6.1 Conclusions
- What can you conclude from the project?
- Have you solved the problem in a better way? Will your solution be benefitial to the society and IT Commnity in General?

6.2 Recommendations
- What recommendations can you draw from the project?
- It is recommended that....
	- E.g For better Results, the Ram should be added from 3 Gb to 6 Gb

6.3 Future Works
- Tell future reseachers what you would like to see in the project in case they choose to do a similar thing
- e.g In case CNN was used, you can tell them to use RNN for better results or a different opinions
	- What you'd like to be added to the project in case a similar work is done in the future
